- **Node.js** (v20.18.0 or higher)
- **Composer** (for PHP dependencies)
- **MySQL** (v8.2.25 or higher)
- **Laravel** (v10)
- **PHP** (v8.2 or higher)

## Backend Setup (akredoc-backend)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hafizhvito/Akredoc
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd akredoc-backend
   ```

3. **Install PHP dependencies using Composer:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Set up your environment file:**
   - Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your database and other configurations (like mail settings).

5. **Generate the application key:**
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run migrations to set up the database:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Seed the database (optional):**
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

8. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Setup (akredoc-frontend)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   cd ../akredoc-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**

3. **Set up your environment file (if applicable):**
   - If you need any environment variables (like API base URL), create a `.env` file and configure it.

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port, depending on your setup).
